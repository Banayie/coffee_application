- Customers can browse the menu, place orders, and track their order status.
- Staff can manage and update orders efficiently.

#Future Development / Roadmap
- Integrate cashless payment options: Support for e-wallets (e.g. Momo, ZaloPay, VNPay) and bank transfers to provide flexible and secure checkout for customers.
- Connect with Spotify API: Fetch the list of songs currently playing in the coffee shop so customers can view and suggest tracks in real time.
- Implement QR code scanning at tables: Allow customers to scan a QR code at their table to place orders directly from their phone, enhancing convenience and reducing wait time.
